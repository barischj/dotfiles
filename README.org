* NixOS and macOS configuration.
System configuration is in =configuration.nix= and home configuration is in =home.nix=.
** NixOS
After installing NixOS (below) and logging in, clone this repository and run =sudo ./get-config.sh=. This will symlink the files in this repository to their expected locations on the system.

To apply the system configuration run =sudo nixos-rebuild && reboot=. To apply the home configuration run =home-manager switch=.

Final steps:
- login to Firefox
- login to Bitwarden
- login to insync
- install Doom Emacs
*** Installing NixOS on an external SSD
Run the scripts TODO, use GParted to check the device name (e.g. =sdc=) and replace =sda= in the scripts.

Set =nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;= and uncomment a few options to create a minimal =configuration.nix=.

Install and reboot with =sudo nixos-install && reboot=. Login as =root= and set a password for =jeremy=.
** macOS
- TODO: redo =with nix-darwin=

# =bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barischj/dotfiles/master/macos-install.sh)=
